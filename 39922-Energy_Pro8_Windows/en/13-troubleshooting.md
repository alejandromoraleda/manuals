## Troubleshooting
1.	Why can't I play some MP3 files?
The MP3 file must follow the "layer 3" standard for MPEG1, MPEG2 and MPEG 2.5 formats. Otherwise, it must be converted using a specific software.

2.	My Energy Tablet does not turn on, what can I do?
Make sure that the battery is charged enough to power the device. If after leaving the device charging for at least 30 minutes the problem continues, there may be a problem with the installed operating system. Please, refer to the "Updating" section of this manual.

3.	Why can't I play some WMA files?
Make sure you are not trying to play WMA file with DRM.

4.	Why can't I see my video, image or text files when using the music player?
Generally, applications only display the files supported by the program. Therefore, while you browse the folders using a specific application, you can only see the files associated to that program (songs in the music player, videos in the movie player, etc).  In order to see all the files stored in the internal memory, start the FileXplorer application from the application menu.

5.	Which video formats are compatible with my Energy Tablet?
Your Energy Tablet can play multiple video formats wihtout recoding.

6.	Why can't I display my .jpg images?
Many digital cameras and image editing software add hidden data to .jpg files. This can prevent your Energy Tablet from loading the images. Try to delete them and save the image with another name.

7.	The built-in memory of the Energy Tablet is lower than the specified in the specifications. Why?
The Android#trade# operating system and the preinstalled applications need approximately 1.5GB to work. Therefore, the available memory for additional data is less than the specified.

8.	I updated the firmware but I no longer have any multimedia files nor wallpapers. How can I retrieve the contents that came preinstalled?
Before any system update, we recommend making a backup of everything you want to keep. In www.energysistem.com, you will find not only all the content that came preinstalled in your Energy Tablet, but many more multimedia files and additional wallpapers.

9.	What must I do to install an application?
First, make sure that the file has the Android#trade# application extension (.APK). Android#trade# will ask you to activate the application installation from "Unknown sources", this option is disabled for safety. To authorize the installation of applications, you only have to follow the instructions on the screen the first time you try to install an application:  Settings / Security / Unknown sources (activate).

10.	How long does the battery last?
It depends largely on the use, such as the screen brightness, use of headphones or speaker, if the Wi-Fi connection is enabled or disabled and the power consumtion required by the apps, games, etc.
