## FM Radio

In order to use the radio function, you will have to scan for available radio stations, which then will be stored in the device's memory. It is not necessary to repeat this procedure unless you change location or modify the radio stations.

Press and hold the MODE button (5) during 4 seconds when being in radio mode. This will save all stored radio stations in the device's internal memory. This process may take a few minutes.

Pressing the forward (13) or backward (2) buttons will allow you to change between different stations. You can also change between different radio stations by pressing and holding the forward (13) and backward (2) buttons.
