## MP3 function with external memories

To play MP3 files, insert an external memory such as a USB stick or a SD/MMC memory card into the corresponding slot, (12) and (10) respectively. "USB" or "SD" will appear on the display, deppending on the type of memory you are using.

If you switch off the *Energy Tower 8* or remove the external memory, the music playback will continue where it stopped.

To skip a track, use next (13) and previous (2) buttons. To move forward and backward in the same song, press and hold for 4 seconds the forward (13) and back buttons (2).
You can change the folder by pressing the button (4).

## Playback order

The folders included in the memories are read in chronological order and all songs contained in these folders are read in alphabetical order.

For example: after creating two folders called ‘A’ and ‘B’, we copy first the ‘B’ folder and then the ‘A’ folder. This way the first played song will be the first one from the ‘B’ folder.

Here you have a diagram of the reading order:
