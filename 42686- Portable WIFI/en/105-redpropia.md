## How to connect to the speaker's own network

The *Energy Multiroom* speakers create their own Wi-Fi network in order to interact with all other devices that belong to the same product range. These networks can be identified easily since the default name follows the  "Energy Multiroom_XXXX" structure in which XXXX is a unique indicator of each device. The network's name can certainly be modified accesing the device setup wizard. For more information, please see "Wi-Fi setup wizard".

You can connect directly to the Wi-Fi network created by your speaker. This network is encrypted by default and uses a WAP-PSK (AES) password. The default password is *0123456789*. We recommend to change this password for another one that you can easily remember. You will be able to do this from the application, through the "Device information" menu, or from the device setup wizard. For more information, please see "Wi-Fi setup wizard". 

The main advantage of this mode is that: 
- You don't need a router.

Limitations:
- You cannot establish a Multiroom connection. You will only control one speaker in App mode.
- You won't have access to the Internet on the device that you're currently using.
