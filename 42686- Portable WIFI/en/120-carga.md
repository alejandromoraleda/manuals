## Charging the battery

When the speaker stops emitting sound or the battery icon starts blinking, it is time to charge it. Connect the mcroUSB end of the included USB cable to the CHARGING PORT (9) and the other end to any USB port that can provide energy (PC, USB wall charger, car, etc). The LED (8) will turn red and once the charge is completed it will turn off.

**Note:** It is recommended to turn off the device when charging.  Do not store or leave the device disused for a long period of time with the battery completely discharged.
