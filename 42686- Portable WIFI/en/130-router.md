## Minimum router requirements

In order for the speakers to work via Wi-Fi correctly, the router of your private network must fulfill the following requirements:

- For the Wi-Fi, you will need a <b>2.4 GHz</b> band. The Multiroom system is not compatible with 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands.

- It is necessary that the net to which you connect the speaker is encrypted with a WAP PSK key via AES or that it doesn't use a password at all.

- The router has to support the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) in order to enable the communication with the speakers.

- The net to which you want to connect the speaker has to enable the SSID broadcast.

- Considerations related to advanced router settings that can cause problems:
 - Assign static IP addresses.
 - Filter the connections by MAC addresses.
 - The router is being used as a portal. If in order to access the Internet it is necessary to set up a net access code from an Internet browser, it won't be possible to set up the speaker so that it can connect to these type of routers. <br/>

- Network environments with high levels of noise or a low performance level between router and speaker can result in mistakes that affect settings. Please verify that the distance between the speaker and the router is not excessively long and that the Wi-Fi channel is not overflowed.
