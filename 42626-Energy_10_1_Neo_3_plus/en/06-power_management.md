## Charging the device

Your Energy Tablet has a built-in rechargeable Li-Ion battery. Initially the battery is charged at the factory, but it is highly recommended that you perform a full charge before the first use. Recharge the battery by connecting the device to the outlet only using the AC/DC included with the product. The charging time ranges from 2 to 4 hours, depending on whether the device is off or running. To ensure these times, always charge your tablet via the USB cable and the power adapter included with the product.
