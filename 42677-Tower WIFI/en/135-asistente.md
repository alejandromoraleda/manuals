## Wi-Fi setup wizard

Your *Energy Multiroom Tower Wi-Fi* comes with a Wi-Fi setup wizard to adjust all the Wi-Fi parameters of your speaker.
There are two options to run the setup wizard: 

1. The first one consists in connecting to the network's Tower. In order to know how to connect to this net, please see the "How to connect to the speaker's net" section and access the <b>10.10.10.254.</b> IPS address from an Internet browser.

2. The second option consists in accesing the speaker's IP address from a device connected to the same network as the speaker using an Internet browser. This IP address appears in the "Speaker info" option within the apps settings menu.

Once you have accessed, the "Wi-Fi" menu will appear. You will access the speaker's network information through this settings menu. The active network's name will appear on top of the screen while a list of all available networks will be shown below. If you select any network from the list, the active Wi-Fi network selected for your speaker will change to that one.

Within the "Settings" menu we will find three tabs. The "Status" tab contains general information on the device such as specifications, firmware versions or the IP address if we are connected to any network. 
  
In the "System" tab you will find the option to change the language of the Setup wizard. It is necessary to save all modifications by pressing the "Save" button. The speaker's firmware can be updated manually or online. You can also restore the default settings to return to the state by default.

The "Network" tab offers you the possibility of changing the password, the type of encryption as well as the name of the speaker's Wi-Fi network.
