## How to make your speaker connect to your Wi-Fi network

You have two alternative options to establish the connection apart from the standard procedure that has been described in the "Initial settings" section.

The first option consists in connecting to the speaker's network. For more information please see the "How to connect to your speaker's network". Once the connection has been established, you need to access the device intallation wizard and force the speaker to connect to a specific network, as explained in the "Wi-Fi setup wizard" section.

The second option to connect the speaker consists in using the app. This option is only available for Android devices. If after completing the device connection process you get an error message, you can access a window with the steps to set up the Wi-Fi network and restart searching. Press "Manually connect to a network".

At this moment you have to run the app in the background (without closing it) and access your device Wi-Fi settings. You will have to connect to the speaker's Wi-Fi network next. For more information please see "How to connect to the speaker's network". Once you have done this, restore the app to full-screen again so that you return to the point where you were. Now the "Next" option, which was hidden, will appear on the screen upper corner.

Press this button to access the menu with all networks that can be accessed from the speaker. Select the network you want and set it up if necessary. This way, you will have forced the speaker to connect to your private network.
