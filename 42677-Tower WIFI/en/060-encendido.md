## Switching the tower on and off

Once the *Energy Multiroom Tower Wi-Fi* has been plugged into a socket, turn it on by moving the ON-OFF SWITCH (16) on the back side of the tower to the "ON" position.  From that moment on, you can turn it on or off by pressing the PLAY/PAUSE button (8) on the top display for 2 seconds or the ON/OFF button (23) on your remote control.

If you are not going to use the tower for a long period of time, we recommend, not only to switch it off from the top display but also to turn the ON-OFF SWITCH (16) to the "OFF" position.
