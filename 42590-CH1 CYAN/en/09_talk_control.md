## Talk Control

Having your *Energy Headphones CH1 Bluetooth* paired with your smartphone, you will be able to receive phone calls and use the built-in microphone (6) to talk from the own device.

To answer a phone call you only need to press the PLAY/PAUSE button (2) once. In case you were listening to a song at the moment you receive the phone call, the music playback will stop automatically and you will hear a ring tone.

To end the phone call, press the PLAY/PAUSE button (2) once, the playback will resume from the moment you received the phone call.
