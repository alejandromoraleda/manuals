To turn off the eReader, hold the button (3) until a warning window appears and push "OK" on the screen. A short press of this button (3)  will put your eReader on standby mode, which is a special low-power mode that lets you instantly return to the last screen by just pushing the button again.

When your eReader is in standby mode or switched off, it will display an image on the screen indicating their status. Do not worry, this image does not consume energy.
