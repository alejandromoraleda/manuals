You can also update your eReader Energy through your computer. The process is simple but must be done carefully and only when really necessary.

Follow the steps below to install:

Make sure the battery of your Energy eReader is fully charged. Otherwise Energy connect your eReader to external power using a USB charger (5V / 1Ah max.), or the USB port of your computer and wait until the battery is fully charged.

Access the website www.energysistem.com from the web browser on your computer.

Enter the "Support" section and select the type of product "eReader".

Choose your Energy eReader model from the dropdown list that appears, and then download the latest version of OS files available.

*Important:*
Make sure the operating system version you are downloading is specific to your eReader model and serial number, since otherwise it could damage the device.

Unzip the file to your computer.

Open the text file included in the download and follow the instructions for installing the new operating system on your Energy eReader.
