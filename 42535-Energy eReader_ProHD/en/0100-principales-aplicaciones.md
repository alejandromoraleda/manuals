### Dictionary feature and app

Your Energy eReader Pro HD incorporates a dictionary feature that lets you install any "StarDict" compatible database. StarDict format is one of the most widespread formats of electronic dictionaries, created with free GNU GPL tools.

You can use both commercial dictionaries of leading publishers such as those created by the community for free, or even create your own.

To enjoy the Dictionary application on your Energy eReader, the first thing you have to do is download the dictionary files to your computer. Usually, "StarDict" dictionaries are composed of 3 files in * .dz (or * .dict) * .idz (or * .idx) and * .ifo formats. You will need all three to use the dictionary. Now you must follow these simple steps:

- 1) Connect your eReader to your computer, and use the file browser to access the internal memory of your eReader.
- 2) Once in the main root folder create a folder called "dict" (eg x: / dict /)
- 3) Copy directly the dictionary files in this new folder, or create subfolders with the names of the dictionaries you want to add (Drae, Catalan-Spanish, etc ..)
- 4) Restart your eReader after installation.

Once installed dictionaries and restarting your eReader can use this function directly while reading a book, making a long press on the word you choose, and selecting "Dictionary" in the popup window.
