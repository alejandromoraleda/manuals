## Music Playback

Your Energy MP4 allows you to enjoy music in MP3 / FLAC / WMA / WAV formats thanks to its high-fidelity sound processor. 

To access the music playback menu, select the *Music* option and press *Play / Pause (7)*.

You will access directly the different music playback options. Move from one option to the next by using the *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (7)* button to select. Press *MENU (1)* briefly to go back or keep it pressed to return to the main menu.

**"All Songs"**: 
With this option you will see all songs stored in your Energy MP4 memory, sorted alphabetically by file name.

**"Albums"**, **"Artists"** and **"Genres"**: You will see the list of your favourite music sorted by album/ artist/ genre respectively.

**Notice:**In order to see audio files in those lists, the details concerning the artist, the album or the title must be registered in the file (these details are known as ID3-Tags). There are many free programs to create or modify the ID3-Tags such as "MP3 Tag" or "ID3 Renamer"

**Notice:** Song lyrics are text files named exactly after the music file but adding the LRC extension. If your songs do not contain this LRC file, lyrics will not be displayed, but you will be able to listen to the music without problems.

If the song contains the lyrics (LRC file), they will be displayed on screen, otherwise the Equalizer will be shown instead.

**"Playlists"**: This option will enable you to access a customized list of songs.  There are 3 editable lists available to add songs: *Playlist on the go [1]*, *Playlist on the go [2]* and *Playlist on the go [3]*. To add songs to the list, you must access the music playback mode (select 'All songs', by album, artist or genre or by browsing the internal memory or card).  Select the song you would like to add to the playlist and press the *Play / Pause button (7)*. At that moment, the song will be played automatically. You can access the playback settings submenu by pressing and holding the *MENU (1)* button for 2 seconds while the music playback is on or paused. Then, select the option *Add to playlist* to add the current song to one of the playlists available.


**"Create Playlist"**: Use this option when you store or delete songs to create again playlists by album, artist or genre.



**"Local folder"**: 
This option allows you to browse the folders of your *MP4 Touch* internal memory or microSD external memory and select the music file you prefer, just like you would do it from your computer.

To start music playback, access the file you would like to be played by selecting any of the options mentioned above: 'All songs', 'album', 'artist', 'genre' or by browsing the internal or card memory. 

To start, pause or resume music playback press the *Play / Pause button (7)*.

Press briefly the *Back (8) and Next (5)* buttons to change to the previous/next track respectively. You can also rewind / fast-forward the song by pressing and holding the Back (8) / Next (5) buttons respectively.

You can access the playback settings submenu by pressing and holding the *MENU (1)* button for 2 seconds while the music playback is on or paused:

**"Play mode"**:
