## Folder navigation

This function allows you to directly choose the folder and the music / video / image file you would like to play, previously sorted on your PC.

You can browse your folders in *Music / Video / Photo* mode. 

Please keep in mind that while you are browsing the folders in a specific section, only the file types associated to that section will be displayed (music files with *Music*, image files with *Photo*, etc.). 

In order to see all the files stored in the internal memory at the same time, choose the *Folders* option in the main menu.

With the *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* buttons you can select the previous/next folder or file. With the *Play / Pause (7)* button you will be able to access the selected folder or file.

To go back in the folder navigation menu, press *MENU (1)* briefly, or press it and hold it to return to the main menu.
