## Bluetooth connection

Access the Bluetooth menu and select the *Bluetooth Status* option in the submenu in order to enable the Bluetooth function. In this option, make sure the Bluetooth is on by choosing *Enable Bluetooth*.

To pair a Bluetooth device for the first time, select the *Bluetooth Search* option in the submenu. The device will perform a search and show a list of the devices found. This process may take a few minutes. Make sure your earphones or your Bluetooth speaker are also in synchronisation mode. 

Once the device has been found, select it from the search list, then select the 'Bluetooth Pairing' option. 

**Notice:** If once you have selected the device, you see the *'Bluetooth Unpairing'* option, it means that it has been paired to your *Energy MP4* before and it will be available in the *'Bluetooth Device List'*.

Once the device has been paired, it will be saved in the memory and you will be able to connect it every time you use the *BLUETOOTH* mode of your *Energy MP4* from the *Bluetooth Devices List* option in the submenu. By choosing the *Bluetooth Devices Connected* option you can reactivate the connection with the device on the list. 

**Notice**: To perform a new device search, we should select the *Bluetooth Unpairing* option on the *Bluetooth Device List* and repeat the operation by selecting the *Bluetooth Search* option from the submenu.

In order to listen to your music via Bluetooth connection, select the *All songs* option in the submenu. This will open the list of all songs stored in your MP4 player, either in your MP4 Touch internal memory or in the microSD external memory. You can select the file you prefer, just as you would do from your computer.

With *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* buttons you can select the previous/next folder or file. With the *Play / Pause (7)* button you will be able to access the selected folder or file.

To go back in the folder navigation menu, press *MENU (1)* briefly.

Select the *Music* option in the submenu to access the music playback menu, select the 'MUSIC' option in the main menu and press “Play/Pause”.

Your Energy MP4 allows you to enjoy music in MP3 / FLAC / WMA / WAV formats thanks to its high-fidelity sound processor. 

To start, pause or resume music playback press the *Play / Pause button (7)*. Press briefly the *Back (8)* and *Next (5)* buttons to change to the previous/next track respectively.

You can access the playback setting submenu by pressing the *MENU (1)* button while the music playback is on or paused:

**"Shuffle"**: 
Songs are played in a random order. *'Shuffle'* mode is disabled by default so you will have to enable it when using your *Energy MP4* for the first time.

**"Repeat"**: 
You can choose your favourite mode through this option: "Repeat 1" (it repeats the current track) and "Repeat all" (it plays all tracks continuously) and "View Playing" (it plays the 10 first seconds and changes to the next track).

**"Equalizer"**:
This option will allow you to equalize the audio according to your preferences. Among the 7 predefined modes are: "Off" (no adjustments will be made in the equalization of played music), "Rock", "Funk", "Hip Hop", "Jazz", "Classical" or "Techno".
