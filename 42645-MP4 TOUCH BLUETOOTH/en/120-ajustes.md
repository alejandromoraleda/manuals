## Settings

You can configure many aspects of your MP4 'Touch' very easily.
To do that, access **System setting** from the main menu. Move from one option to the next by using the *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (7)* button to select.

**Sound settings**: This option enables you to set the volume limit of your *MP4 Touch* audio output.

**Sleep timer**: This option allows you to set the time for the MP4 player to sleep, whether it is in playback mode or not. Choose '0' minutes if you don't want to enable sleep timer on your *MP4 Touch*.

**Backlight timer**: You will be able to adjust the time that it takes for the display to turn off automatically when no buttons are pressed. Choose the 'Always on' option for the display to be always on.


**Interface Style**: You can change the device interface. 'Red', 'Grey' or 'Green' versions are available.


**Language**: You can switch the user interface language to Spanish, English, French, etc.
