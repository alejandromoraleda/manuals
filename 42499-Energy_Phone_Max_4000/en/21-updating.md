## Updates

Your Energy Phone Max 4000 has an Androidâ„¢ operating system that can be reinstalled or updated if necessary. Updates will be carried out via OTA (Over-The-Air) by default, so your Energy Phone will automatically connect to our servers, download the file and install the new software as soon as an update is released.

You can also update your Energy Phone Max 4000 using your computer. The process is simple but has to be done carefully and only when it is really necessary. If the device does not respond, restarts unexpectedly or you experience problems accessing the content stored on the internal storage memory, you should reinstall or update the operating system to the latest compatible version available.

Please follow these steps to install it:

1. Make sure that the battery of your Energy Phone Max 4000 is fully charged. If this is not the case, plug it to the external power source using the provided AC/DC power adapter and wait until it is fully charged.

2. Access the www.energysistem.com website on your computer.

3. Enter the "Support" section and choose "Smartphone" in the type of product.

4. Choose your Energy Phone model from the dropdown list that appears and then download the latest Android#trade# operating system version available in the Download/Firmware section. **Important:** Please make sure the operating system version you are downloading is intended for your model and serial number, otherwise the device could be damaged.

5. Unzip the file on your computer.

6. Open the text file of the download and follow the instructions to install the new operating system on your Energy Phone Max 4000.
