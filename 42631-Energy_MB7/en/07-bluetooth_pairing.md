## Bluetooth Pairing

Everytime you turn on your *Energy Music Box B2 Bluetooth*, pairing mode will start automatically; at the same time, the search and pairing process will start on your Bluetooth® device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc). Once you have identified the *Energy B2* on your device, select "Connect" and both devices will pair each other immediately with no need of pairing codes; the speaker will play a sound indicating that the connection has been established.

To pair the speaker with the last device again, you only need to turn on the *Energy Music Box B2 Bluetooth* and the synchronization will start automatically.

If you want to pair another Bluetooth® device, keep the CONTROL TALK button (5). The current pair will stop and the device will start another Bluetooth® synchronization.
