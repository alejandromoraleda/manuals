## Firmware reinstallation

Your *Energy MP3* has an operating system installed, commonly known as firmware, that sometimes needs to be reinstalled. If you find that the MP3 player is not responding, reboots randomly, or you have problems to access the memory content from your computer, try to press RESET (hole next to the micro USB connector) by using a pin or a needle. If the problem persists, it will be a sign that the firmware has been damaged and needs to be reinstalled.

In order to reinstall the firmware, access manually **www.energysistem.com** from a web browser. Select your model in the product section and download the proper firmware version from the download area. Unzip the file in your computer and follow the instructions included in PDF format.
