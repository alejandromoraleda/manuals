## Voice recorder

Your *MP3 Clip* enables you to perform voice recordings thanks to its built-in microphone. To access the voice recording mode, select the *Record mode* option from the main Menu with the Play / Pause (4)* button.

You will access directly the recording interface. Press 2 times (briefly) the *Play / Pause (4)* button to start the recording process. Right after, the recording time indicator above will start blinking '000:00:00â€™, then press *Play / Pause (4)* to start recording. During the recording process, you can pause the recording by pressing *Play / Pause (4)* briefly. Press the *Menu (5)* button for a few seconds to finish the recording. A 'RECXXX' file will be stored in the default recordings folder.

In order to access the saved recordings, we recommend you to select the 'VOICE MODE' from the main menu (see the section that comes afterwards).

From the recording menu, you can access the recording settings menu by pressing the *Menu (5)* button to see the different options available. You will be able to select the recording type from 32, 64, 128, 192 or 384 kbps among others in WAV format.

Move from one option to the next by using the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (4)* button to select. Press and hold the *Menu (5)* button to exit the settings submenu. 

Press and hold the *Menu (5)* button to return to the main menu.
