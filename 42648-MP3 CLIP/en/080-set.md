## Settings

You can configure many aspects of your MP3 Clip very easily.

To do that, access *System setting* from the main menu. Move from one option to the next using the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (4)* button to select:

**Backlight**: With this option, you will be able to adjust the time that it takes for the display to turn off automatically when no buttons are pressed. Choose '0' seconds for the display to be always on.

**Language**: You can switch the user interface language to Spanish, English, French, etc.

**Power off**: This option enables you to optimize your *MP3 Clip* battery life in two ways: 

1. It turns off completely after a period of inactivity. To do that, choose the *Off time* option. This option works in 'seconds'. Choose '0' seconds to ensure that the device will never turn off, not even when it is in sleep mode.

2.  It turns off after a given period, even while playing or when active. To do that, choose the *Sleep time* option. This option works in 'minutes'. Choose '0' seconds to ensure that the device never turns off.

**Contrast**: This option allows you to edit the display brightness.

**Reset**: This option enables you to restore the device default settings.

**Auto lock**: Through this option, you can set the time (in seconds) for the device buttons to lock automatically. Choose '0' seconds to ensure that the device will never lock, not even when it is in sleep mode.
