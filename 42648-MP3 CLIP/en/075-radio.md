## Radio mode

Your *MP3 Clip* has an integrated FM Radio with some presets and direct recording option. To listen to the radio, select the *FM Radio* option in the main menu. 

From the FM Radio Mode, use the Next (3) or Back (1) buttons to browse the frequencies range and, by keeping the buttons pressed, you can perform auto searches. 

To tune in the stations automatically, access the radio submenu by pressing the Menu (5) button and selecting 'Auto Search'. Once you have performed an automatic search of stations, use the Play /Pause (4) button to change from one saved station to another. This way, you can browse all your saved stations.

*Notice*: Make sure your earphones are properly connected to the audio output. Otherwise, the FM search won't be performed correctly.

There are some different options available in the FM Radio submenu. Move from one option to the next by using the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (4)* button to select. Press again the *Menu (5)* button to exit the settings submenu.

**Save**: This option allows you to save the current station in the next free preset. If all presets are taken, the station won't be saved. The current station will be saved in the internal memory of the device as "01". Repeat this process to list up to 20 stations in the order you prefer.

**Record**: You can record the FM radio broadcast on WAV audio files.
To start recording, select this option and press the *Play / Pause (7)* button. You can pause the recording by pressing briefly *Play / Pause (4)* and resume it afterwards by pressing again *Play / Pause (4)*. To finish the recording, keep the *Menu (5)* button pressed. Access the radio recordings saved through the 'Voice Mode' from the main menu.

**Delete**: This option allows you to delete the current preset.

**Delete all**: This option allows you to delete all the presets.

**Auto Search**: It scans the frequency range and stores the first 20 stations found in the presets.

Press and hold the *MENU (1)* button for a few seconds to return to the main menu. Once you are in the main menu, the FM radio reception will finish.
