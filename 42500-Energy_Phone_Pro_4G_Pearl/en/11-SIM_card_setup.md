Your Energy Phone Pro 4G Pearl offers the possibility of using a microSIM card and a nanoSIM card at the same time or a microSIM card and a microSD card. In Settings > SIM Management, you can manage the use of both cards.

In this section you can set the default card to make or receive calls, send and receive text messages and set the data connection.
