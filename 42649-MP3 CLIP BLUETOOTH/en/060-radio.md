## Radio mode

Your *MP3 Clip* has an integrated FM Radio with some presets and direct recording option. To listen to the radio, select the *FM Radio* option in the main menu. 

Move from one option to the next by using the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (4)* button to select. Press and hold the MENU (5) button to return to the main menu.

In order to create a first list of presets, you should use one of the available search options from the menu: manual or automatic.

*Notice*: Make sure your earphones are properly connected to the audio output. Otherwise, the FM search won't be performed correctly.

**Presets**: Through this option, you will access the list of presets previously saved in the MP3 memory. A list of up to 30 presets is available. When using your *MP3 Clip* for the first time, there won't be any preset saved. 

**Manual tune**: You will access directly the frequencies browser. With the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons you can browse the frequencies range. By pressing these buttons you will move one step forward or backward and by pressing and holding the button, you will start the auto search.  Use the *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* buttons to turn the volume up or down respectively and press the *Play / Pause (4)* button to select the preset saved in the favourites list.

**Auto tune**: It scans the frequencies range and saves the first 30 stations found in the presets.

**FM Recording**: This option enables you to access the audio files you have recorded with the FM recording option (check information below). To listen to these files, access the corresponding folder (previously stored in the internal or external memory) from the main menu or, if you are in Folder mode, select the RECORDINGS folder by using the folder navigation function, then select the ‘FMRECXXX’ file you would like to play and press *Play / Pause (4)*.
Exit the Recording mode by keeping the *MENU (5)* button pressed.



Once you have a list of saved stations, keep pressed the *MENU (5)* button while the FM dial window is open and access the radio settings submenu to see the different options available. 

**Start FM radio recording**: You can record the FM radio broadcast on WAV audio files. Select this option with the *Play / Pause (4)* button to start recording. You can pause the recording by pressing briefly *Play / Pause (4)* and resume it afterwards by pressing again *Play / Pause (4)*. To finish the recording, press the *MENU (5)* button.

**Save to preset**: This option allows you to save the current station in the next preset you choose in the stations menu. The current station will be saved in the internal memory of the device. If it is the first one you save, it will be stored as "01". Repeat this process to list up to 30 stations in the order you prefer.

**Clear preset**: This option allows you to remove the current preset from the preset stations list.

**Auto tune**: It scans the frequency range and stores the first 30 stations found in the presets.

Press the *MENU (1)* button to return to the MP3 player main menu. Once in the main menu, the FM radio reception will finish.
