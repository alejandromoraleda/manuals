## Options

You can configure many aspects of your MP3 Clip very easily.
To do so, access *Set* from the main menu. Move from one option to the next by using the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (4)* button to select:

**Play mode**: 

1)	*Play music from...*:

You can select your preferences through this option by: "Artist", "Genre" or "Album". If you don't select this option, 'All songs' in the current list will be played by default.


2)	*Repeat*:

You can choose your favourite mode through this option: "Repeat 1" (it repeats the current track) and "Repeat all" (it plays all tracks continuously) and "View Playing" (it plays the 10 first seconds and switches to the next track).

3)	*"Shuffle"*: 

Songs are played in a random order. *'Shuffle'* mode is disabled by default. So you will have to enable it when using your *Energy MP3* for the first time.

**Sound settings**: This option enables you to set the volume limit of your *MP3 Clip* audio output.
**Sleep timer**: This option allows you to set the time for the MP3 player to sleep, whether it is in playback mode or not. Choose '0' minutes if you don't want to enable sleep timer on your *MP3 Clip*.
**Display settings**: You will be able to adjust the time that it takes for the display to turn off automatically when no buttons are pressed. Choose the 'Always on' option for the display to be always on.

**Language**: You can switch the user interface language to Spanish, English, French, etc.
