## Folder navigation

This function allows you to directly choose the folder and the music / video / image file you would like to play, previously sorted on your PC.

In order to see all files stored in the internal memory at the same time, choose the *Folder view* option from the main menu.

With the *Next (3)* or *Back (1)* buttons you can select the next/ previous folder or file. With the *Play / Pause (4)* button you will be able to access the selected folder or file.

To go back to previous options in the folder navigation menu, press *MENU (5)* briefly.
