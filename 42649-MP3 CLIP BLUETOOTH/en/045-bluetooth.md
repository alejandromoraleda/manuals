## Bluetooth connection

Access the Bluetooth menu and select the "Bluetooth Status" option from the submenu to enable the Bluetooth function. 

To pair a Bluetooth device for the first time, select the "Bluetooth Search" option from the submenu. The device will perform a search and show a list of the devices found. This process may take a few minutes. Make sure your earphones or your Bluetooth speaker are also in synchronisation mode. 

After you have successfully paired a device, it will be saved in the memory and you will be able to connect it again through the "Bluetooth Device List" option from the submenu. 

In order to listen to your music via Bluetooth connection, select the "All songs" option from the submenu. This will open the list of all songs stored either in the device internal memory or in the microSD card external memory.

**Notice**: To perform a new device search, we have to select the *Bluetooth Unpairing* option on the *Bluetooth Device List* and repeat the operation by selecting the *Bluetooth Search* option from the submenu.

You can reactivate the deviceâ€™s connection on the *Bluetooth Device List* by selecting the *Bluetooth Pairing* option or delete the device from the list by selecting the *Bluetooth Unpairing* option.

In order to listen to your music via Bluetooth connection, select the *All songs* option from the submenu. This will open the list of all songs stored in your MP3 player, either in your MP3 internal memory or in the microSD external memory. You can select the file you prefer, just like you would do from your computer.

With the *Next (3)* and *Back (1)* buttons you can select the next/ previous folder or file. With the *Play / Pause (4)* button you will be able to access the selected folder or file.

To go back to previous options in the folder navigation menu, press *MENU (5)* briefly.

Select the *Music* option from the submenu to access the music playback menu, then press *Play / Pause (4)* to open the menu.

Your Energy MP3 allows you to enjoy codified audio in MP3 / FLAC / WMA / WAV format. 

To start, pause or resume music playback, press the *Play / Pause (4)* button. Press briefly the *Next (3)* and *Back (1)* buttons to change to the next/ previous track respectively.

You can access the playback settings submenu by keeping the *MENU (5)* button pressed while the music playback is on or paused:

**"Repeat"**: 
You can choose your favourite mode through this option: "Repeat 1" (it repeats the current track), "Repeat all" (it plays all tracks continuously) and "View Playing" (it plays the 10 first seconds and switches to the next track).


**"Shuffle"**: 
Songs are played in a random order. *'Shuffle'* mode is disabled by default so you will have to enable it when using your *Energy MP3* for the first time.


**"Equalizer"**:
This option will allow you to equalize the audio according to your preferences. Among the 7 predefined modes are: "Off" (no adjustments will be made in the equalization of played music), "Rock", "Funk", "Hip Hop", "Jazz", "Classical" or "Techno".
