## Settings

You can configure many aspects of your MP4 'Touch' very easily.
To do that, access *Settings* from the main menu. Move from one option to the next by using the *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* buttons and use the *Play / Pause (7)* button to select.

**UI version**: You can change the device interface. Coral, Grey or Mint versions are available.

**LCD set**: With the *Dark mode* option, you will be able to adjust the time until the display turns off automatically when any button is pressed. Choose '0' seconds for the display to be always on.

**Language**: You can switch the user interface language to Spanish, English, French, etc.

**Power off**: This option enables you to optimize your *MP4 Touch* battery life in two ways: 

1. It turns off completely after a period of inactivity. To do that, choose the option *Off time*. This option works in 'seconds'. Choose '0' seconds to ensure that the device will never turn off, not even when it is in sleep mode.
2.  It turns off after a given period, even while playing or when active. To do that, choose the *Sleep time* option. This option works in 'minutes'. Choose '0' seconds to ensure that the device never turns off.
