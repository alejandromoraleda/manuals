## Image viewing

View and enjoy your BMP / JPG / GIF images and photos thanks to the TFT high-resolution screen of your *MP4 Touch*.

To view your images, select *Picture* from the main menu. You will access directly the file explorer (check the *Folder* section), then choose the picture you want with *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* and press the *Play / Pause (7)* button to view it.

Press briefly the *Back (8)* and *Next (5)*, buttons to change to the previous/next image respectively. Access the option submenu by pressing the *MENU (1)* button. 

The **Playback set** option in the submenu allows you to set the playback mode (auto or manual play).

Press and hold the *MENU (1)* button for a few seconds to return to the main menu.
