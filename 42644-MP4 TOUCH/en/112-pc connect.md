## PC connection

In order to enjoy the best sound and your favourite music on your *Energy MP4*, you have to copy these files from your PC to its internal memory first.

Connect the MP4 player to your computer USB port through the USB connector and it will be automatically detected by your computer without installing any driver. 

Once it is detected, you will be able to read/write on the device memory, just as if it was a regular drive.

Once the data transfer is finished, disconnect the MP4 player from the computer.

*IMPORTANT*: To prevent data loss, always remove the USB device safely before disconnecting the MP4 player. In Windows XP, for instance, the safely remove hardware icon is on the start taskbar, near the clock.
