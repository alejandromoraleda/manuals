## Music playback

Your Energy MP4 allows you to enjoy music in MP3 / FLAC / WMA / WAV formats thanks to its high-fidelity sound processor. 

To access the music playback menu, select the 'MUSIC' option in the main menu and then press *Play / Pause (7)*.

To start, pause or restart the music playback press the *Play / Pause button (7)*.

Press briefly the *Back (8)* and *Next (5)* buttons to change to the previous/next track respectively. You can also rewind / fast-forward the song by pressing and holding the *Back (8)* / *Next (5)* buttons respectively.

You can access the different playback settings by pressing the MENU (1) button. Move from one option to the next using *Volume + (9)* and *Volume - (6)* and use the *Play / Pause (7)* button to select. To exit the options menu, press MENU (1) briefly, or keep it pressed to return to the main menu.

You can access the playback settings submenu by pressing the MENU button while the music playback is on:


**Repeat**: 
The playback order of songs depends on the selected mode. Selected mode by default is "Normal". You can choose your favourite mode through this option: "Repeat one" (it repeats the current track), "Folder" (it repeats just the tracks in the current folder and then stops), "Repeat folder" (it repeats the tracks in the current folder), "Repeat all" (continuous playback of all tracks), "Random" (all tracks are played in a random order) and "Intro" (it plays just the first 10 seconds and then switches to next track).

**Equalizer**: 
This option will allow you to equalize the audio according to your preferences. Among the 7 available modes are: "Normal", "Rock", "Pop", "Classic", "Soft", "Jazz" or "Bass".

**Replay mode**: 
Replay from A to B: You can continuously repeat a segment of a song with this function. To do so, press shortly the Volume + (9) button to mark the start of the playback (point A) and press again Volume + (9) to mark the end (point B). To cancel this function, press briefly the *Play / Pause (7)* button.

**Create Playlist**: 
Use this option when you store or delete songs to create again playlists by album, artist or genre.

**Notice**: When you disconnect the MP4 player from your computer by using the safely remove hardware option, your 'MP4 Touch' will 'refresh' automatically and will continue in charging mode.

**All songs**: 
With this option you will see all songs stored on your Energy MP4 memory, sorted alphabetically by file name.

**"Album", "Artist" and "Genre"**: You will see the list of your favourite music sorted by album/ artist/ genre respectively.

**Notice**: In order to see audio files in those lists, the details concerning the artist, the album or the title must be registered in the file (these details are known as ID3-Tags). There are many free programs to create or modify the ID3-Tags such as "MP3 Tag" or "ID3 Renamer"

**Notice**: The song lyrics are text files named exactly after the music file but adding the LRC extension. If your songs do not contain this LRC file, lyrics will not be displayed, but you will be able to listen to the music without problems.

If the song contains the lyrics (LRC file), they will be displayed on the screen, otherwise the Equalizer will be shown instead.
By pressing the MENU button while the music playback is paused, you can access the folder navigation submenu and also select directly the folder and the music file you would like to be played:


**Local folder**: 
This option allows you to browse the folders of your MP4 Touch internal memory or microSD external memory and select the music file you prefer, just like you would do from your computer.

**Delete file**: This option allows you to delete the current song.

**Delete all**: This option allows you to delete all songs stored on the internal memory.

**Create Playlis**: 
Use this option when you store or delete songs to create again playlists by album, artist or genre.

**Notice**: When you disconnect the MP4 player from your computer by using the safely remove hardware option, your 'MP4 Touch' will 'refresh' automatically and will continue in charging mode.

**All songs**: 
With this option you will see all songs stored on your Energy MP4 memory, sorted alphabetically by file name.

**"Album", "Artist" and "Genre"**: You will see the list of your favourite music sorted by album/ artist/ genre respectively.
