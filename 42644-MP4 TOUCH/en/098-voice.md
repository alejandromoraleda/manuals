## Voice recorder

Your *MP4 Touch* enables you to perform voice recording thanks to its integrated microphone. To access the voice recording mode, select the *Record* option in the main Menu with the Play / Pause (7)* button.

After that, press the *Play / Pause (7)* button to start recording. You can pause the recording by pressing briefly *Play / Pause (7)*. Press the *MENU (1)* button for a few seconds to finish the recording.

The sound files recorded are stored inside the *RECORD* folder. The files are in WAV format. To listen to these files, access the *RECORD* folder (previously stored in the internal or external memory) in the main menu. You can also access the *RECORD* folder by using the folder navigation function while you are in *Folder* mode, then select the WAV file you would like to listen to and press *Play / Pause (7)*.

Exit the *RECORD* mode by keeping the *MENU (1)* button pressed.
